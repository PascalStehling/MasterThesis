\chapter{Homomorphic Encryption}

Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a specialized cryptographic system that enables the execution of operations on encrypted data in a similar fashion to that of unencrypted data. This capability allows for the outsourcing of data storage and computation to external services while maintaining the confidentiality of the data. This creates a zero-trust environment, where there is no need to trust external providers as they are unable to decrypt the data. Furthermore, the occurrence of data breaches would be effectively eliminated, as the data is always encrypted.


As described in \cite{FheImplementations}, HE algorithms can be grouped into 3 classes:
\begin{description}
  \item [Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE)]\hfill \\one type of operation can be performed an unlimited amount of times
  \item [Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SWHE)]\hfill \\some types of operations for an limited number of times
  \item [Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)]\hfill \\an unlimited type of operations for an unlimited amount of times
\end{description}

As the algorithm will be used on binary data, the operations are often reduced to addition and multiplication, as with these two, all other basic operations can be done in binary space.

The Idea was first developed by Rivest et al. \cite{Rivest1978} in 1978. They also proposed an PHE scheme, based on RSA., for multiplication only. More PHE schemes were developed over time and in 2009 C. Gentry proposed the first FHE scheme \cite{Gentry2009AFH} based on a bootstrapping technique, which refreshes the ciphertext, so that the internal errors are reduced and further calculations can be done. With that, all SWHE systems can be converted into FHE systems. However, the conversion results in a significant reduction in performance due to the computational intensity of the bootstrapping operation.

\section{The R-LWE SWHE Scheme}

As previously stated, the two operations, addition and multiplication, must be implemented within the ciphertext space in order to construct an FHE scheme. All other operations can be derived from these initial two operations. The aforementioned operations will first be created for the R-LWE version of the scheme, which has already been developed. Construction of addition and multiplication will be based on a modified version of the BFV (\cite{bfv}) scheme.

\subsection*{Addition}

The objective is to develop a method for adding encrypted messages in such a way that the result is identical to that obtained by adding the plaintext messages. This can be achieved by adding the ciphertext together, with the error increasing linearly. Further details on this approach can be found in reference \cite{bfv}. 

\begin{algorithm}[htb]
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \REQUIRE $ct_1 = (u_1, v_2)$, $ct_2 = (u_2, v_2)$
    \RETURN $ct_{add} = ([u_1 + u_2]_q, [v_1 + v_2]_q)$
  \end{algorithmic}
  \caption{R-LWE: Addition}
  \label{alg:RlweAddition}
\end{algorithm}

The newly created $ct_{add}$ can then be used, like any other ciphertext, to be decrypted and used for other operations. However, it should be noted that the error in it has increased, which may result in the incorrect result being produced at some point.

\subsection*{Multiplication}

The process of deriving the same result for multiplication is somewhat less straightforward. In order to simplify the following derivations and explanations, the following simplification is made, based on Algorithm \ref{alg: SampleLweDecryption}:

\begin{equation}
  ct(s)_q = v-s\cdot u
  \label{eq:baseCt}
\end{equation}

Also let $ct_1$ and $ct_2$ be two ciphertext that we want to use, with $ct_1(s) = v_1-s\cdot u_1$ and $ct_2(s) = v_2-s\cdot u_2$
The multiplication of these two values results in the equation \ref{eq:ciphertextMultiplication}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    [ct_1(s)\cdot ct_2(s)]_q & = [(v_1-s\cdot u_1) \cdot (v_2-s\cdot u_2)]_q                                          \\
                         & = [v_1\cdot v_2 - v_1\cdot u_2 \cdot s- v_2\cdot u_1\cdot s + u_1\cdot u_2\cdot s^2]_q \\
                         & = [\underbrace{v_1\cdot v_2}_{v_m} - \underbrace{(v_1\cdot u_2 + v_2\cdot u_1)}_{u_m}\cdot s + \underbrace{u_1\cdot u_2\cdot}_{x_m} s^2]_q \\
                         & = [v_m - u_m\cdot s + x_m \cdot s^2]_q
  \end{split}
  \label{eq:ciphertextMultiplication}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:ciphertextMultiplication} results in the formation of three blocks, each dependent on a different power of $s$. In comparison to Equation \ref{eq:baseCt}, it can be observed that the current equation is similar, with the exception of the additional $x_m\cdot s^2$ factor. 
A method is required to approximate $x_m\cdot s^2$ and combine it with $v_m$ and $u_m$. This will reduce the degree of the equation from two to one, which is known as relinearization. The formalization can be observed in Equation \ref{eq:relinFormalized}, where r represents an error that should be minimized to ensure successful decryption.

\begin{equation}
  [v_m - u_m\cdot s + x_m \cdot s^2]_q = [v'_m - u'_m\cdot s + r]_q
  \label{eq:relinFormalized}
\end{equation}

In order to resolve this issue, the "modulus switching" technique from \cite{bfv} will be employed. The initial step is to define a Relinearization Key ($rlk$), which masks $s^2$. In this process, the value $s^2$ will be multiplied with a new constant, $p$. This constant is essential for reducing the error that is generated when "decrypting" the $rlk$ (see equation \ref{eq:RlkDecryption}).
The form of the masked value is based on the public key, such that when $A_{rlk}$ and $b_{rlk}$ are "decrypted" with $s$, the original value $p\cdot s^2$ is obtained. The generation of this $rlk$ is described in Algorithm \ref{alg:RingRLKGeneration}.

\begin{algorithm}[htb]
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \REQUIRE $s$
    \STATE $A \leftarrow R^d_{p \cdot q}$
    \STATE $e \leftarrow \chi_R^{'d}$
    \STATE $b = [A\cdot s+e+p\cdot s^2]_{p \cdot q}$
    \RETURN $rlk:=(A_{rlk}, b_{rlk})$
  \end{algorithmic}
  \caption{R-LWE: RLK Generation}
  \label{alg:RingRLKGeneration}
\end{algorithm}

Utilizing the $rlk$, $x_m\cdot s^2$ is now decomposited into two distinct components. One component, designated $xv_m$, is added to $v_m$, while the other, $xu_m$, is added to $u_m$.

\begin{equation}
  (xu_m, xv_m) = (\left[\left\lfloor \frac{x_m \cdot A_{rlk}}{p}  \right\rceil \right]_q, \left[\left\lfloor \frac{x_m \cdot b_{rlk}}{p}  \right\rceil \right]_q )
\end{equation}

The process of "decryption," as illustrated in equation \ref{eq:RlkDecryption}, reveals that $x_m$, a random element within $R_q$, is multiplied with the error $e_{rlk}$. This results in a significant error value. To mitigate this, the error is divided by $p$, thereby reducing its impact. In order to permit the creation of $x_m \cdot s^2$, $s^2$ was multiplied by $p$ in the $rlk$.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    xv_m + xu_m \cdot s &= \left[\left\lfloor \frac{x_m \cdot b_{rlk}}{p}  \right\rceil \right]_q - \left[\left\lfloor \frac{x_m \cdot A_{rlk}}{p}  \right\rceil \right]_q \cdot s \\
    &\approx \left[\frac{x_m \cdot b_{rlk}}{p} - \frac{x_m \cdot A_{rlk}}{p} \cdot s\right]_q \\
    &\approx \left[\frac{x_m \cdot (A_{rlk}\cdot s+e_{rlk}+p\cdot s^2)}{p} - \frac{x_m \cdot A_{rlk} \cdot s}{p}\right]_q \\
    &\approx \left[\frac{x_m \cdot A_{rlk}\cdot s}{p}+\frac{x_m \cdot e_{rlk}}{p}+\frac{x_m \cdot p\cdot s^2}{p} - \frac{x_m \cdot A_{rlk} \cdot s}{p}\right]_q \\
    &\approx \left[\frac{x_m \cdot e_{rlk}}{p}+ x_m \cdot s^2 \right]_q
  \end{split}
  \label{eq:RlkDecryption}
\end{equation}

The complete algorithm for multiplying can be found in Algorithm \ref{alg:RingMultiplication}. In order for the algorithm to function correctly, it is necessary to multiply the value of $\frac{t}{q}$ by each of the factors. Further details on this process can be found in \cite{bfv}.

    \STATE $u_m = \left[\left\lfloor \frac{t}{q}\cdot(v_1 \cdot u_2 + v_2 \cdot u_1)\right\rceil\right] _q$
    \STATE $x_m = \left[\left\lfloor \frac{t}{q}\cdot(u_1 \cdot u_2)\right\rceil\right] _q$
    \STATE $xu_m = \left[\left\lfloor \frac{x_m \cdot A_{rlk}}{p}  \right\rceil \right]_q$

    \RETURN $ct_m:=(\left[u_m + xu_m\right]_q , \left[v_m + xv_m\right]_q )$
